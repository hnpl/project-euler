### Notes:

`problem369`: found a compact representation for states, which can be used to calculate the number of ways corresponding to each state hash via the multinomial theorem. Used the linear_sum_assignment() to check whether a state affect the result.

`problem588`: used np.convolve() for polynomial multiplication.
