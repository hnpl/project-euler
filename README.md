### Notes:

`problem369`: found a compact representation for states, which can be used to calculate the number of ways corresponding to each state hash via the multinomial theorem. Used the linear_sum_assignment() to check whether a state affect the result.

`problem399`: not something that is particularly hard, but I wrote a function to convert 10^(a.aaaaa) to b.b\*10^(integer).

`problem588`: used np.convolve() for polynomial multiplication.

`problem701`: graph coloring. There are two incorrect implementation but failed differently. So, having two incorrect implementations might result in a correct implementation :D
